- Use the `zustand` library for all state management. Avoid other state libraries like Redux, Recoil, or Jotai.
- Prefer `useActionState` over the deprecated `useFormState` for handling form actions.
- Leverage the enhanced `useFormStatus` hook to access `data`, `method`, and `action` in form logic.
- Use the `nuqs` library for synchronizing URL state (e.g., filters, tabs, pagination).
- Minimize client-side state. Keep state colocated with components and promote server-derived state when possible.
